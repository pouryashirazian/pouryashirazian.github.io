# EDUCATION
- University of Victoria, Ph.D.
Victoria, BC, Canada (graduated in 2015) - Major in Computer Science

- Iran University of Science and Technology, M.Sc.
Tehran, Iran (graduated in 2008) - Major in Electronics and Computer Engineering

# EXPERIENCE

- `July 2016 - Present` Senior Software Engineering Manager [[Intuitive Surgical Corp.](https://www.intuitive.com)]

Leading research and product development for intra-operative image-guided robotics surgery. Contributed extensively to the [da-Vinci Iris][davinci-iris],
a service to order and receive anatomical 3D models generated from a CT scan.

- `July 2015 – July 2016` Senior Software Engineer [[Xilinx Corp.](https://www.xilinx.com)]

Research and development on compute-bound scientific applications that can be optimized using dynamic, flexible architectures.
Developed a high-level synthesis framework for programming FPGAs with OpenCL and the required LLVM-based compiler backend infrastructure.

- `Jan 2015 – June 2015` Senior Graphics Software Engineer, [[Mercedes-Benz R&D](https://www.mbrdna.com)]

Worked with UX design team to implement fluid interacations and cinematic effects with GPU shaders. Other responsibilities:
Graphics framework architect, cross-platform software engineering, embedded system bring-up and configuration, kernel mode driver development.
